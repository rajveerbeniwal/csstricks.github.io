simple way to add another language file

1. copy builder.po into the theme main dir ( under 'builder' folder)

2. rename it ( depend on your language country code ) - example:
   for German rename it into de_DE.po

3. open it with poEdit (or another translator program)

4. Start translate it and save changes! close the program

5. now you will have one new file 'de_DE.mo' 

6. move the 'de_DE.po' and 'de_DE.mo' into 'langs' folder

7/. done!


another simple way is you can use translator plugin like http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/
